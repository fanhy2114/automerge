`AutoMerge` is built on the top of `JDime` (<https://github.com/se-passau/jdime>).
`JDime` is a state-of-the-art structured merge tool, together with unstructured support.
Our Version Space Algebra (VSA) technique is realized as an additional functionality over `JDime`. 
Only for cases that cannot be handled by `JDime`, our approach is activated.
