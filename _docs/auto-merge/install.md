### Jar File

The simplest way to use `AutoMerge` is to download the pre-built [jar file]().

Type `java -jar AutoMerge.jar` to print help.

### Build from Source

For those who would like to develop on the top of `AutoMerge` or `JDime`,
we recommend you to fork [our repository]()
and build it with `gradle`.
